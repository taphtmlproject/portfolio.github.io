   <p>Department of CSE is equipped with specialisations like CSE (AI&ML),CSE(Data Science),CSE(Cyber Security) and widely recognized as an essential source and technique for the advancements in all spheres of human endeavour now and in future. In SVCE all the students get the opportunity to excel in their academic activities. This is the department where students publish papers in international journals, at the same time a student wishing to achieve some recognition in extra-curricular or co-curricular activities will also find the atmosphere helpful. Among the reasons why our graduates are such favorites of industry is the consistent hands-on experience-based approach of our curriculum, our excellent laboratories, the long-time connections between Department and the industry.</p>
   <p>The department houses student branches of professional bodies like IEEE ,CSI and ISTE Student branches often conduct technical and non-technical events to motivate the students. These events hone the soft, technical skills , attitude and self-confidence of the students. Our mission is to drive the concepts into the minds of students and infuse scientific temper in the students and guide them towards research in communication engineering. Students are encouraged to participate in various activities like paper presentation, technical quiz, project design, project contests, sports, NSS, and cultural activities. Students are motivated to undergo In-plant Training and many Industrial visits are arranged every year to get industry exposure.
